# Risk Calculator for Web Developers

A simple, interactive risk calculator designed for web developers to assess the security posture of their web applications. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to evaluate whether key cybersecurity best practices are implemented.

## Overview

The Risk Calculator allows developers to answer a series of questions related to essential security practices. Each question has predefined risk values. Based on the answers, a final risk score is computed and categorized as:

- **Low Risk (0 to 5 points)**
- **Moderate Risk (6 to 15 points)**
- **High Risk (16 to 29 points)**

The project helps identify areas that may need improvement to enhance overall cybersecurity.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** A clean layout with radio buttons for quick assessment.
- **Real-Time Calculation:** The risk score updates instantly after the user submits their responses.
- **Clear Categorization:** Easy-to-understand risk levels to guide security improvements.
